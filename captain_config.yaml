# Captain's personal notes
captain_notes: |
  These settings have been carefully calibrated based on years of 
  experience battling digital pirates across the seven seas.
  
  Remember:
  - Always monitor SERVER_IP:9999 - it's our primary operations port
  - Trust but verify - even crew members can turn pirate
  - The best defense is a good offense - know your adversaries
  - When in doubt, check the logs - they never lie
  
  Fair winds and following seas!
  
  - Captain Jackhood
